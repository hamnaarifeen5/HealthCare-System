# HealthCare-System
Health System RESTful Web service API's implemented with JAX-RS.



A comprehensive test plan for a healthcare system with multiple endpoints (such as those managing appointments, doctors, patients, prescriptions, and other related entities) needs to cover a wide range of tests to ensure the system works as expected, is secure, and handles all edge cases. Here's a detailed outline for such a test plan:
1. Test Plan Overview
•	Purpose: To validate the functionality, reliability, performance, and security of the healthcare system.
•	Scope: This plan covers all endpoints related to appointments, doctors, patients, prescriptions, and associated operations like CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete).
•	Testing Tools: Define any tools or frameworks used for testing (e.g., JUnit for unit tests, Postman for API testing, Selenium for UI testing, etc.).
2. Test Types
•	Unit Tests: Validate individual components or functions in isolation.
•	Integration Tests: Check how different components work together.
•	API Tests: Ensure each endpoint behaves as expected.
•	UI/UX Tests: Validate the user interface and experience.
•	Performance Tests: Measure response times and load handling.
•	Security Tests: Test for common security vulnerabilities (e.g., SQL injection, CSRF, XSS).
3. Test Scenarios
3.1. Appointments Endpoint
•	GET /appointments:
•	Test retrieval of all appointments.
•	Validate the response format and content.
•	Ensure response times are within acceptable limits.
•	GET /appointments/{id}:
•	Test retrieval of a specific appointment by ID.
•	Validate handling of non-existent ID (404 response).
•	POST /appointments:
•	Test appointment creation.
•	Validate required fields and proper error handling.
•	PUT /appointments/{id}:
•	Test updating an existing appointment.
•	Validate error handling for invalid or non-existent ID.
•	DELETE /appointments/{id}:
•	Test deletion of an appointment.
•	Ensure proper response for valid and invalid ID.
3.2. Doctors Endpoint
•	GET /doctors: Test retrieval of all doctors.
•	GET /doctors/{id}: Test retrieval of a doctor by ID.
•	POST /doctors: Test doctor creation.
•	PUT /doctors/{id}: Test doctor update.
•	DELETE /doctors/{id}: Test doctor deletion.
3.3. Patients Endpoint
•	GET /patients: Test retrieval of all patients.
•	GET /patients/{id}: Test retrieval of a patient by ID.
•	POST /patients: Test patient creation.
•	PUT /patients/{id}: Test patient update.
•	DELETE /patients/{id}: Test patient deletion.
3.4. Prescriptions Endpoint
•	GET /prescriptions: Test retrieval of all prescriptions.
•	GET /prescriptions/{id}: Test retrieval of a prescription by ID.
•	POST /prescriptions: Test prescription creation.
•	PUT /prescriptions/{id}: Test prescription update.
•	DELETE /prescriptions/{id}: Test prescription deletion.
4. Test Cases
Each scenario should have multiple test cases. For example:
•	Create Appointment:
•	Test creating an appointment with valid data.
•	Test creating an appointment with missing data.
•	Test creating an appointment with invalid data.
•	Update Doctor:
•	Test updating a doctor with valid data.
•	Test updating a doctor with invalid data.
•	Test updating a doctor that doesn't exist.
5. Performance Testing
•	Response times under various loads of healthcare system.
•	Test the ability of healthcare system to handle concurrent requests.
•	Test healthcare system bottlenecks or performance degradation.
6. Security Testing
•	Test for common vulnerabilities of healthcare system.
•	Test user authentication and authorization mechanisms.
•	Ensure secure data handling and storage.
7. Test Execution and Reporting
•	Execution: Define how tests will be executed in healthcare system (e.g., automated, manual).
•	Reporting: Describe how test results will be reported and analyzed in healthcare system.
•	Issue Tracking: Specify tools or processes for tracking issues found during testing in healthcare system.
8. Test Coverage and Acceptance Criteria
•	Define the minimum test coverage required for each endpoint.
•	Establish acceptance criteria for each test case (e.g., expected response, acceptable error handling, performance thresholds).
With this comprehensive test plan, you should be able to test all aspects of your healthcare system to ensure it meets the required standards for functionality, reliability, performance, and security.
